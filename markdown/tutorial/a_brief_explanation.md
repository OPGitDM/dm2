# A brief explanation of Git (Github) #

---

Git is presented as something extremely easy and in theory it is but I found it very frustrating to learn. **Extremely so**. 

---

Basically, Git is a version control system. This will allow editors/authors in DM2 to collaborate their work on an ongoing fashion. 

Github is a particular one I propose we use since it does seem to be the most used. 

---

(One of the things that was hard for me to grasp is the fact that the file(s) need to be in a certain directory on your local computer and once editing is complete you have to 'add' then 'commit' this and then push to the git repository).
The basic process goes like this:

```

file -> edit -> commit to git -> push to github repository

```

### Github Desktop ###

Github has created a downloadable app that you use to upload (push) your files and download (fetch) from the github repository. I explain how to get this below. 


---

## Repositories ##

Repositories are the directories where you keep everything. I have created one repository for DM2 for the time being. 

---

## Branches ##

I propose two banches. One called 'main' for the main file for each course to be. This is the master and final copy.  The other would be called 'production' which would be a file produced por production purposes from the main. From this file we can produce the presentions and PDF's. 
Obviously a backup must be kept of the main branch on the DM2 'mainframe'. 

---

Each user clones the main file and creates their own branch. Each time they make a change and upload to their branch, those changes will be reflected to the DM2 repository to be reviewed line by line of any changes. Changes are reflected in colours and easy to spot. At the beginning of each changed line you will see + or - to see the additions or deletes. 

---

The administrators of the repository have access to be able to commit any changes from any branch to the main branch. If a mistake is made at any point, you can return to a previous version before changes were made. 

---

## Projects ##

Projects are for watching the process more carefully. Not entirely sure if this is something we want to employ.

## Get Started ##

Ready to go? Go to:

1. Create an account in github.com
	http://www.github.com
2. Download and install the github desktop app. 
	https://desktop.github.com/
3. Log to the Desktop Github app using your github username

---

4. Clone the DM2 repository. Go to the url below and clic on the green 'code' then open with Gibhub Desktop.. This downloads the files to your local directory (probably documents). 
	https://github.com/johnwry/dm2
5. Download Typora (markdown editor)
	https://typora.io/

### Markdown ###

6. You will need to take a few minutes to learn markdown to begin editing. It's meant to be simple and keep you on track with the content, not design.

# Typora # 
A great markdown editor I have found is Typora. In beta stage it is also free. 
Theoretically you can do markdown in any text editor or word processor although I believe Microsoft Word requires a plugin to work.
