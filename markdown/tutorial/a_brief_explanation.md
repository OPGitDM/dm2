# A brief explanation of Git (Github) #


Git is presented as something extremely easy and in theory it is but I found it very frustrating to learn. Extremely so. 


Basically however, Git a version control system. Github is the particular one I propose we use since it does seem to be the most used. 
One of the things that was hard for me to grasp is the fact that the file(s) need to be in a certain directory and once editing is complete you commit this and then push to the git repository. 
like this:
file -> edit -> commit -> push to github



## Repositories ##
Repositories are where the files reside. I have created one repository for DM2. 



## Branches ##
I propose two banches. One called 'main' for the main file for each course to be. This is the master and final copy.  The other would be called 'production' which would be a file produced por production purposes from the main. From this file we can produce the presentions and PDF's. 
Obviously a backup must be kept of the main branch on the DM2 'mainframe'. 


Each user clones the main file and creates their own branch. Each time they make a change and upload to their branch, those changes will be reflected to the DM2 repository to be reviewed line by line of any changes. Changes are reflected in colours and easy to spot. At the beginning of each changed line you will see + or - to see the additions or deletes. 


The administrators of the repository have access to be able to commit any changes from any branch to the main branch. If a mistake is made at any point, you can return to a previous version before changes were made. 



## Projects ##
Projects are for watching the process more carefully. Not entirely sure if this is something we want to employ. 



## Getting Set up ##
Ready to go? So go to:

1. Create an account in github.com
http://www.github.com
2. Download and install the github desktop app. 
3. Clone the DM2 repository



# Typora # 
A great markdown editor I have found is Typora. In beta stage it is also free. 
Theoretically you can do markdown in any text editor or word processor although I believe Microsoft Word requires a plugin to work.
